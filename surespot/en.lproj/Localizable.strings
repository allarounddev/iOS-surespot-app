Surespot can backup your identities to the Documents folder where they will be available in iTunes via File Sharing, or Google Drive.

For maximum security we recommend using the Documents folder backup. Once backed up, the identity file should then be saved from iTunes (via File Sharing 'Save to...') to a secure location so that it may be restored in the case of app uninstall, restoring an old backup, lost or stolen device, or other data loss.

If you elect to backup your identity on Google Drive you will be storing a copy of your private keys on Google Drive servers. Should a third party somehow gain access to the Google Drive servers and attempt to decrypt your identity file by brute force attack, be aware that the strength of your password will ultimately determine their success.";
